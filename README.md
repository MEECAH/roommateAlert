# roommateAlert
currently a simple CLI application that sends a notification to my phone if my roommate's phone eithers connects or disconnects from our wifi.

planning to create a simple UI so that you can use this with your own router login info, MAC addresses of interest, and your phone. 

Currently only supports Netgear WNDR4500 and Android phones.
