# roommateAlert
Currently a simple CLI application that sends a notification to my phone if my roommate's phone eithers connects or disconnects from our wifi.

Planning to create a simple UI so that you can use this with your own router login info, MAC addresses of interest, and your phone. 

Currently only supports Netgear WNDR4500 and Android phones using the [join application](https://joaoapps.com/join/).
